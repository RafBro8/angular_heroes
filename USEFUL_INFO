IN COMPONENT:
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Tour of Heroes';
}

IN HTML:
<h1>{{title}}</h1>

The double curly braces are Angular's interpolation binding syntax.
This interpolation binding presents the component's title property value inside the HTML header tag.


Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications.
They display data on the screen, listen for user input, and take action based on that input.

@Component is a decorator function that specifies the Angular metadata for the component.

selector— the component's CSS element selector
templateUrl— the location of the component's template file.
styleUrls— the location of the component's private CSS styles.

The ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook. Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component.
It's a good place to put initialization logic.

Always export the component class so you can import it elsewhere ... like in the AppModule.

Pipes ( | ) are a good way to format strings, currency amounts, dates and other display data.
Angular ships with several built-in pipes and you can create your own.

Services are a great way to share information among classes that don't know each other.
Use Dependency Injection to inject Service into Component's constructor
@Injectable() decorator marks the class as one that participates in the dependency injection system.
